# QR Label Creator
## Overview
This is a python script for generating printable sheets of unique inventory labels with corresponding QR codes on them.

****NOTE: If you are reading this, I am still in the process of cleaning up the script up and updating this doc so that you can run it easier. It was origionally written in a rush so I could just get it to work in a short period, but I never took the time to make it easier to use. Once this happens, I will update this document.**

## Supplies

The script is designed for specific sized labels which can be found in the link(s) below. Please let me know if you want to alter the script for a different size. Make sure you purchase a material that works for the printer. (If using the printer in the lab, you shoudld make sure that the label is ok for inkjet printers.)

## Setup

There are two ways to run this script. 

For now, this guide will focus on the macOS opperating system, but as long as you have a valid version of python working on your target system, the scripts should work fine.

### Option 1
If you already have python 3.6 or higher, you can just run the script directly from this repository.

To check your active python version, open your terminal and type:

    python --version

You should see a response something like: `Python x.x.x`. where the x's stand for a numbers. You should have greater than or equal to `Python 3.6.x` or know how to install, otherwise continue to **Option 2** below.

### Option 2

For ease of use, I have  bundled this script which should allow you to download and run it easily.
